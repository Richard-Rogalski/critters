# critters
If you can think of a clever name for this project please open a discussion/issue and let me know, I'm not of the creative type.  
If you're curious on what this is, shhhhhhhhh

#### Where are my current unlocks & settings stored?
I believe in transparency. All of these and more are stored in a JSON file. You are perfectly able to edit it yourself with no repurcussions. 

#### Why are three languages (HTML, XML, CSS) in one HTML file?
I would very very very much like to know the answer to this myself. Long story short, you can only interact with an SVG if the SVG is inlined into the HTML file, at least in the way I need to. So, this monstrosity is required. If you know of a better way to do what I'm doing with SVGs, and doesn't hinder browser compatability, ***please*** pretty please with a cherry on top let me know. 

#### No license?
I will cover this all with a free license in the future, however while this is all immature, I will not be posting any of this to any extension host sites. Plus, I will probably not open a google account to host it on the chrome web store anytime soon. Many of these sites are full of malicious extensions; it would be trivial for someone to bundle this with some malicious scripts, host it on the web store, and many might think of an extension to be official or trustworthy because there's no duplicates. This is my primary reason for keeping it as rights-reserved for the moment; I want to keep my legal rights and autority to smite down rehosted instances of it that are potentiall malicious. However, I believe you all should at least have the right to view the source in an accessible and documented manner while this project is in this stage, which is why I'm hosting this on a publit github repo. *When* I do decide to give this a license, I will likely choose a GPL. 

#### Why a GPL?
If you know me, you'd know I generally prefer more permissive licensing. However, I believe licensing is not one-size-fits-all. For many of the reasons stated above I believe a copyleft license suits browser extensions better.
